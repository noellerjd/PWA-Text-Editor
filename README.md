## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create notes, codesnippets without requiring an internet connection in order to reliably retrieve them for later use.

I built this project to become more familiar with PWAs, how they work, and when to properly use them. 

This project is looking to make  taking notes and looking back at them later a lot easier without needing an internet connection.
